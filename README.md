# Delete-Every-Users-Discord-Message

[!] This is not a purger, it's a script for trolling that repeatedly deletes a users new message whenever they try and write something


Possibly the most annoying thing ever if you don't know what's going on.
This classifies as a selfbot and is against discord tos -- this was made for a demonstration and using it is your responsibility + choice, so I won't take responsibility for actions/problems caused.
